Aspect Suggestion Service

Generates high-level aspect categories from a sample of customer comments.
This is a one-time suggestion pass that runs before the main analysis.

Step 2 of the workflow:
- Samples 50-100 comments from uploaded file
- Uses constrained prompt to identify domain and suggest aspects
- Returns 6-12 high-level aspect categories

Your task is to analyze the following customer comments and do TWO things:
1) Identify the most appropriate industry or service domain the feedback belongs to.
2) Generate a concise, actionable list of high-level feedback categories ("aspects") suitable for analyzing feedback in that domain.

IMPORTANT RULES:
- The industry/domain must be a clear, commonly understood category (e.g., Hospitality, SaaS, E-commerce, Fintech, Logistics, Healthcare, Education, etc.).
- Aspects must represent broad, reusable experience or responsibility areas within that industry.
- Each aspect should be something a team or function could reasonably own or improve.
- Use short noun or noun-phrase labels only.
- Do NOT generate aspects that are:
  - Too generic (e.g., "experience", "overall", "service quality")
  - Too specific or issue-level (e.g., "AC not working", "login button broken")
  - Full sentences or complaints
- Do NOT exceed 6–10 aspects.
- You are NOT analyzing sentiment.
- You are NOT summarizing feedback.
- You are ONLY identifying the domain and proposing grouping dimensions.
- These aspects are suggestions and will be reviewed and approved by a user before analysis begins.

Customer comments:
{comments}

Return ONLY valid JSON in the following format:

  "identified_domain": "industry_or_service_domain",
  "suggested_aspects": [
    "aspect_1",
    "aspect_2",
    "aspect_3"
