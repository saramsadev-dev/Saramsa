## YOUR TASK
For each work_item_candidate in the input, generate a rich, specific work item using the analysis metrics AND the sampled customer comments provided.

## INPUT
The JSON below contains:
- "overall": overall sentiment breakdown
- "features": feature-level sentiment data with keywords
- "work_item_candidates": deterministic candidates (each has candidate_id, aspect_key, type, priority, reason)
- "comment_samples": actual customer feedback quotes mapped by candidate_id

{serialized}

## OUTPUT — VALID JSON WITH THIS EXACT SCHEMA

{{
  "insights": [
    "max 5 high-level observations about the feedback trends"
  ],
  "features": [
    {{
      "aspect_key": "pricing",
      "description": "1-2 sentence summary of what customers are saying about this feature"
    }}
  ],
  "work_items": [
    {{
      "candidate_id": "must match a candidate_id from the input",
      "title": "Specific, actionable title (max 100 chars). Reference the actual problem, not generic 'Improve X'",
      "description": "2-4 sentences synthesizing the key themes from customer comments. Quote specific customer phrases when available. End with a recommended action.",
      "acceptance_criteria": "3-5 measurable bullet points separated by ' | ' that define when this work item is done",
      "business_value": "Impact statement using the actual metrics from the input (comment count, negative %, proportion of total feedback)"
    }}
  ]
}}

## STRICT RULES
1. **CRITICAL**: Output one work_item for EACH candidate_id in the input. Do NOT add or remove candidates.
2. **CRITICAL**: Use the EXACT candidate_id value from each work_item_candidate (e.g., "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890"). Copy it character-for-character. Do NOT generate new IDs or modify existing ones.
3. Do NOT change type, priority, or any metric values — you only write narrative text (title, description, acceptance_criteria, business_value).
4. Do NOT include priority, type, or metric numbers in the title.
5. For "title": Be specific. BAD: "Improve Pricing based on feedback". GOOD: "Restructure pricing tiers to address cost concerns".
6. For "description": Reference actual customer language from comment_samples. Group feedback into 2-3 themes. End with a concrete recommendation.
7. For "acceptance_criteria": Write measurable outcomes, not vague goals. BAD: "Fix the issue". GOOD: "Billing page shows itemized breakdown before charge".
8. For "business_value": Always reference the actual numbers (e.g. "350 comments, 55% negative, largest feedback category").
9. insights: max 5 items.
10. features: only for aspect_key values present in the input.
11. If comment_samples is empty for a candidate, still generate rich text based on the aspect_key, keywords, and metrics available.
12. For candidates with type "strength": write a title highlighting what customers love (e.g. "Preserve fast one-click checkout experience"), a description of what makes it successful with customer quotes, acceptance criteria focused on maintaining/amplifying the strength, and business value emphasizing retention/differentiation.
13. Return ONLY valid JSON. No explanation or commentary outside the JSON.
