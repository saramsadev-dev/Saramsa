You are an expert customer feedback analyst. Analyze the following structured customer feedback data for {company_name} and provide actionable insights.

## OVERVIEW
- Total Comments Analyzed: {total_comments}
- Processing Method: Local ML Pipeline (all-MiniLM-L6-v2 + cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest)
- Sentiment Method: Aspect-relative (sentence-level sentiment per matched aspect)
- Aspect Matching: Bi-encoder cosine similarity with tiered thresholds (0.60 strong / 0.55 weak)

## AGGREGATED STATISTICS
Overall Sentiment Distribution:
{_format_overall_sentiment(aggregated_stats.get('overall_sentiment', {}))}

Confidence Distribution:
{_format_confidence_distribution(aggregated_stats.get('confidence_distribution', {}))}

Unmapped Comments: {aggregated_stats.get('unmapped_percentage', 0):.1%} ({aggregated_stats.get('unmapped_count', 0)} comments)

## ASPECT-LEVEL ANALYSIS
{_format_aspect_analysis(aggregated_stats)}

## REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE COMMENTS
The following are {len(representative_samples)} representative comments selected proportionally across sentiments:

{_format_sample_comments(representative_samples)}

## TASK
Based on this comprehensive analysis, provide a JSON response with exactly this structure:

```json

    "insights": [
        "Key insight 1 about customer sentiment patterns",
        "Key insight 2 about specific issues or praise",

        "Key insight 5 (optional)"
    ],
    "features": [

                "positive": 65.0,

    ]
}}
```

## REQUIREMENTS
1. **Insights**: 3-5 key insights focusing on actionable patterns, not just statistics
2. **Features**: Include ALL aspects with significant comment volume (>5% of total)
3. **Work Items**: Generate specific, actionable items based on negative sentiment and improvement opportunities
4. **Keywords**: Use actual words from customer comments, not generic terms
5. **Priorities**: High for critical issues affecting many customers, Medium for improvements, Low for minor enhancements

Focus on actionable intelligence that can drive product and service improvements.
